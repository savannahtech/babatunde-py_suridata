- This is my solution to the Suridata backend exercise 
- It contains two main files
    - main.py
    - unit.py

    -main.py is the main program, while unit.py is a test file. 
    -The adopted testing method is unit testing

- To run the file, run the unit.py file from the command line. 
- Please ensure that you are in the same directory as the files
- run the unit.py file from the command line
